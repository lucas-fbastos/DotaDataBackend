# Dota Data
 _Created to help players improve their own skills in  Dota 2 (while i improve mine in java and SpringBoot ✌️_)

### Powered by Open dota https://github.com/odota
The idea behind this app is to collect data (provided by open dota) and analyze to show my weak spots as a casual player. 
In a near future i want to add a feature to compare personal data with professional players, to see what are the differences and what the average player could do to improve.

## 🌠Features

- Query trough recent matches
- Search info about professional players
- Compare your stats with other players
